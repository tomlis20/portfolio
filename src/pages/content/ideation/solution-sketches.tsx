            <h3>I&apos;ll take a sharpie!</h3>
            <p>Here are a few solution sketches I did for design sprints that I faciliated.</p>
            <p>Crazy eights and solution sketching are my favourite exercises. Brainstorming under the time pressure. Hammering down the scope. Getting something out ASAP rather than waiting for perfection.</p>
            <p>I use the same approach when trying to come up with a concept for a feature outside of a design sprint.</p>
            <p>Give me a sharpie, a napkin and I will show you the way!</p>
            <p>(I know it&apos;s against the rules for the facilitator to take part in the exercises, but I couldn&apos;t resist... ðŸ¤«)</p>
